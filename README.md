# 3D-Game

This is a 3D game that was created with 3 other team members.
Unity Software was used as well as the C# programming language.
My contribution to this project was that I worked on the Character Movement and Camera Movement. 
To have the character Jak walk, press the "W" key. If you want Jak to run, press the "W" key and the "left shift" button at the same time. To change direction, use your mouse to move around. 

Instructions on how to play the 3D Game:
Step 1: Download all the files from the repository to your local machine/computer.
Step 2: Click on the "f21_proj_3a_forever_jak-main" folder.
Step 3: Click on the "Releases" folder.
Step 4: Click on the "F21_Proj_3A_Forever_Jak.exe" file.
Step 5: Enjoy!
